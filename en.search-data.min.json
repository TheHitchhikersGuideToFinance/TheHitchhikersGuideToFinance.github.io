Site Organization  Menu Pages   Commit and Push Adding html     Create a GitHub Account and Setup SSH    Instructions for how to do this can be found here.\nClone the Repo    Cloning the repository creates a local copy that you can modify and test before committing it to the main project. Instructions can be found here.\nInstall Hugo    This site is built using hugo so you must have it locally in order to build the site. Instructions for how to install it can be found here.\nRun the Site Locally    At this point, you should have then entire site downloaded locally and a way to run it, so, let\u0026rsquo;s test it! Using the command line, navigate to the location where you cloned TheTravelGuide. Once there, run hugo server -D. You should be able to open the website by navigating to localhost:1313 in your browser.\nDownload Atom    This step is recommended. If you already have a text editor and GitHub manager, feel free to skip this step. The rest of this guide will be referencing Atom.\nDownload Atom here.\nEdit the Site!    At this point, you have everything you need to make edits and view them locally. Open Atom, navigate to File -\u0026gt; Add Project Folder, and then add TheTravelGuide folder that you previously cloned.\nSite Organization    Menu    The menu is the navigation list on the left side of the website. The contents and organization of the menu can be found in the data -\u0026gt; menu -\u0026gt; main.yml file and more information can be found here. This site uses a bundle menu.\nPages    Contents of each page can be found in the corresponding _index.md file, in the within each folder. When a new page is created, a new folder and a new _index.md file must be created. A list of features that are provided in this submodule and can be used in building this website, such as code blocks, buttons, columns, hints, equations, etc., can be found here.\nCommit and Push    Once your edits are made, and you have previewed them to ensure the site functions correctly, it is time to integrate them to the live website. This can be done by navigating to the Git tab in the bottom right of Atom. Once there, click Stage All, write a short message, and click Commit to main. Then click the Push button that appears in the bottom right. That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nAdding html    Adding html that is outside the scope of hugo and this submodule is not recommended but sometimes unavoidable, such as adding videos. To do this, navigate to the layouts -\u0026gt; shortcodes folder. Create a file that ends with .html, such as mycode.html and insert your html code in here. This code can then be used in any page by using {{\u0026lt; mycode \u0026gt;}}.\nTo insert a .mp4 video, for example, you can use the html shortcode that has already been created. Store the video in the static -\u0026gt; videos folder, and insert the video in any page using {{\u0026lt; addmp4vid myvideofile \u0026gt;}}.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/help_build_the_community/maintainers/","title":"Maintainers","parent":"Help Build the Community","content":"This site is currently maintained by:\nLunarnautics - I write all my contributions in this voice.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/market_basics/","title":"Market Basics","parent":"Welcome to The Hitchhikers Guide to Finance!","content":""},{"id":18,"href":"/market_basics/account_types/","title":"Account Types","parent":"Market Basics","content":""},{"id":19,"href":"/market_basics/account_types/cash_vs_margin/","title":"Cash vs Margin","parent":"Account Types","content":""},{"id":20,"href":"/market_basics/account_types/tax_advantaged_accounts/","title":"Tax Advantaged Accounts","parent":"Account Types","content":""},{"id":21,"href":"/market_basics/charts_float_marketcap/","title":"Charts Float Marketcap","parent":"Market Basics","content":"General overview of charts, candlesticks, chart frequency(1hr,4hr,24hr,etc), what is a market cap, what is a float, beta, PE ratio, EPS, Dividend, volume\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/market_basics/further_education/","title":"Further Education","parent":"Market Basics","content":"Here are some links to external websites with more in depth information:\nInvestopedia Financial Dictionary\nKhan Academy\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/market_basics/psychology/","title":"Psychology","parent":"Market Basics","content":"the idea would be to talk about how psychology plays into trading.
