This location is represented in the form of numbers, such as [65.156.112.48]. Since this is a unique location, it can be used to identify your physical location and track your activity across the internet.\nA VPN is a service that routes all traffic from your device to the VPN providers servers, and then they use their IP address to send your data across the internet. Thus, if anyone was to trace your activity on the internet, it would trace back to your VPN provider.\nIn addition, since the information sent between your device and your VPN provider is encrypted, your internet service provider will no longer be able to view your activity.\nTrusting a VPN Provider\nIf you use a VPN, your privacy is only as good as your VPN provider. The provider may log your activity and then sell these to 3rd parties or hand them over to governments. Be very weary of free VPN providers, since they all have to pay bills somehow.  General Recommendations\n Use a VPN - Pay for it Do not use a VPN based in a country who is part of Five Eyes Use a provider who runs RAM-Only servers  "},{"id":7,"href":"/digging_resources/reddit_subs/","title":"Reddit Subs","parent":"Digging Resources!","content":"list of reddit subs relevant to gme, amc, bb?\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/due_diligence/AMC/","title":"Amc","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"amc stuff\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/due_diligence/BB/","title":"Bb","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"BB stuff\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/due_diligence/GME/","title":"Gme","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"gme stuff Can this be integrated here?\nwikAPEdia\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/help_build_the_community/","title":"Help Build the Community","parent":"Welcome to The Hitchhikers Guide to Finance!","content":""},{"id":12,"href":"/help_build_the_community/edit_with_github/","title":"Edit With Github","parent":"Help Build the Community","content":"recommend using Atom which is a foss from github\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/help_build_the_community/maintainers/","title":"Maintainers","parent":"Help Build the Community","content":""},{"id":14,"href":"/help_build_the_community/overview/","title":"Overview","parent":"Help Build the Community","content":"This site is built using hugo with the Geekdoc submodule and hosted on GitHub\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/market_education/basics/","title":"Basics","parent":"Education","content":""},{"id":16,"href":"/market_education/basics/charts_float_marketcap/","title":"Charts Float Marketcap","parent":"Basics","content":"General overview of charts, candlesticks, chart frequency(1hr,4hr,24hr,etc), what is a market cap, what is a float, beta, PE ratio, EPS, Dividend, volume\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/market_education/basics/psychology/","title":"Psychology","parent":"Basics","content":"the idea would be to talk about how psychology plays into trading.
